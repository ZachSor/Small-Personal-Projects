## Personal-Projects
These are some of the smaller python projects that I've worked on. Most of these done throughout my time in school, and some of them were out of school. 

### Battleship
I made this game to emulate the real-life battleship. Now you are playing against a computer rather than another person. A randomly generated boat appears on your screen, while an empty array represents the array of guesses you've used. The game goes on until either player wins. It utilizes arrays, indexing the turtle graphics library, conditional statements, and counting variables.

### Grade Calculator Fall 2020
This project was a simple grade calculator that I made to calculate my grades faster. On Canvas, during the fall, we didn't find out what our grades were like until the very end, so I decided to make my calculator so I could at least predict how I was doing. I later tested it with my final grades, and it was good. This function has multiple sub-functions representing each class and the associated grading policy associated with it. In this project, I used functions, sub-functions, and basic math.

### Mount Fuji Turtle Graphics
This project was a school project where I made an image using turtle graphics. The final image is of Mount Fuji, and I can specify the number of decorations I want in the image, like trees, clouds, stars, etc. Again this function has multiple sub-functions representing each decoration.

### Red Hands Game
I made this game to emulate another game I had played on my phone. The game has two roles a swiper and a dodger. You can only get points as the swiper, and if the swiper missed the role switched. The first person to get a set number of points wins. Now you are playing against a computer rather than another person. It utilizes sub-functions, conditional statements, and counting variables.
