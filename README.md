# Personal-Projects
There are a number of projects I've been working on especially throughout quarantine in order to keep myself productive.
I've worked on mostly python projects however I am starting to learn C++ thanks to Arduino
I have Arduino projects, python projects, and am hoping to expand this list more as time goes on.
