## Personal-Projects
These are some of the smaller python projects that I've been worked on. Most of these done throughout my time in school and some of them were out of school. 

### Battleship
This was a game I made to emulate the real life battle ship but instead now you are playing against a computer rather than another person. A randomly generated boat appears on your screen while a blank array represents the array of guesses you've used. The game goes on until either player wins. It utilizes arrays, indexing the turtle graphics library, conditional statements, and counting variables.
